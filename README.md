## Usage:

Right clicking on a tab shows additional options like "Pop out", "Reset History", and "Export logs".

Clicking a tab with middle mouse button can also pop the tab out into it's own window.

Scroll and click to lock position while reading, return to the bottom to resume snapping to most recent message.

Text can be copied with Ctrl+C.

If you have "Hide Sidebar Icon" enabled and close the pop out window, you will need to toggle the plugin on/off with Auto-Pop enabled to have it auto-pop back out.

Timestamp Format can be set using SimpleDateFormat patterns.



## Notes:

Max lines of chat is 10,000.

When toggling plugin on/off it does not remember messages. 

"Hide pop out button" and "Auto-pop out window" do not work together.
